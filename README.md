# uc-ride-sharing-assignment
Year 3 java testing assignment to create a ride sharing app.
Drivers can create trips with stops and use those trips to set up routes at specific times. 
The passengers can then book themselves on a route that is availible if there is space and will the notified if it is cancelled.
Doesn't handle the rides actually taking place. Mostly just a booking service.

The main focus was to use cucumber testing and unit testing to test the funtionality of the app.
No thought was put into the UI.
Uses a small part of the google maps api.
